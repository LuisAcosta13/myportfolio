                <h3 className="about_subtitle">üöÄ My experience</h3>
                My latest experience as a FrontEnd Dev allowed me to participate 
                in projects for american and french enterprises using my Javascript 
                and SASS knowledge, integrating my work with backend and design team.
                I worked with SCSS, JQuery, React, Next.js, Wordpress, php, Symfony 
                and SULU. I also had the chance to lead a migration team with 8 people, 
                working on details to clone a full online website from Wordpress to SULU.
                <br/>
                I led the creation of an E-commerce for the sale of supermarket products, 
                actively participating in the UI/UX design, integrating the work of the 
                entire team to achieve a completely integrated, intuitive and pleasant result.
                <br/>
                I studied as a Full Stack developer at Henry's bootcamp, perfecting my 
                Front-End and Back-End bases, acquiring knowledge in React.js, Redux, Node.js, 
                Express.js, PostgreSQL and Sequelize, and adding an excellent use of Javascript,
                 with its libraries and frameworks.
